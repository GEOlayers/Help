GEOlayers is your new best friend when you want to design and animate maps. It hooks you up with up-to-date geospatial data and satellite imagery. It lets you design complex map styles with a few clicks and animate them in 3D space. Watch this tutorial to get started. Learn how to create Mapcomps, change styles, animate, and finalize them.

# Mapcomps

Mapcomps are Compositions filled with map imagery and/or geographical labels.
They are the basic building block of each GEOlayers project.

To start a project you need to create a Mapcomp. Do this by creating a new project from the projects window or click the little arrow top left in the main window and hit + Add Mapcomp.

There are two steps to add a new Mapcomp:

1. Composition options and location
Choose a name, pixel size, duration, and framerate. These values are set from the currently selected composition. Don't forget to navigate the preview map to the location you're interested in. You can also use the search bar to jump to a place. Once you did this hit Next
2. Map Style
Now select a basic style for your map. You can select imagery presets from the section below the preview map, choose color presets, or change individual colors. The Mapcomp can be styled more detailed once it is created, so hit Create for now!
Now you can see the actual Mapcomp has beed created in the currently selected composition. Above it you can see the Mapcomps anchor layer. This is a helper layer that matches the Mapcomp's view animation and can be used to parent layers.

If you don't want to start from scratch you can also choose a sample project to start from. Find the projects panel in the context- or flyout menu of the GEOlayers panel.

Whenever you open a project that already contains Mapcomps you can see and select them clicking  top left in the main window. This will open the Mapcomp list.

As you hover over a Mapcomp the following buttons appear:
